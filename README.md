Hey there! 👋

I’m Juan, a junior developer from Málaga, Spain 🇪🇸, at the beginning of my programming journey. I’ve worked on multiple projects using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I’m always looking to learn more and get better every day.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me doing sports, spending time with dogs, or enjoying a good drive.

Learning, building, and improving every day 🚀
